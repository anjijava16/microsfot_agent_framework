"""Group chat orchestration — travel agents collaborating in one room.

Pattern
-------
In GROUP CHAT orchestration a central orchestrator coordinates a shared
conversation, deciding who speaks next (round-robin, a selector function, or an
agent-based orchestrator). All agents see the full history and iteratively
refine each other's work until a termination condition is met.

Agents used here (3 agents in a shared chat):

    Planner   : proposes / revises the itinerary
    BudgetHawk: pushes back on cost, demands cheaper alternatives
    Reviewer  : final quality gate; says "APPROVED" when the plan is solid

Speaker selection: a custom round-robin selector cycles
    Planner -> BudgetHawk -> Reviewer -> Planner -> ...
Termination: stop once the Reviewer says "APPROVED" (or after a max of rounds).
