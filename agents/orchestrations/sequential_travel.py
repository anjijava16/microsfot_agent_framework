"""Sequential orchestration — a pipeline of travel agents.

Pattern
-------
In SEQUENTIAL orchestration agents run one after another in a fixed order.
Each agent sees the conversation so far and adds its contribution, then passes
the (now richer) conversation to the next agent. This is ideal when every step
*builds on* the previous one.

Pipeline used here (4 agents):

    DestinationResearcher  ->  FlightPlanner  ->  HotelPlanner  ->  ItineraryWriter

    1. DestinationResearcher : gathers facts about the destination.
    2. FlightPlanner         : picks flights (uses the search_flights tool).
    3. HotelPlanner          : picks lodging (uses the search_hotels tool).
    4. ItineraryWriter       : synthesizes everything into a day-by-day plan.
