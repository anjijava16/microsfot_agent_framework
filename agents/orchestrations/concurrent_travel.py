"""Concurrent orchestration — travel specialists working in parallel.

Pattern
-------
In CONCURRENT orchestration every agent receives the SAME task and works on it
*simultaneously and independently*. Their answers are then aggregated. This is
ideal for gathering diverse perspectives on one question (ensemble reasoning).

Specialists used here (4 agents, all run at once):

    FlightExpert   : flight strategy / routing advice
    HotelExpert    : lodging recommendations
    ActivitiesExpert : things to do / experiences
    BudgetExpert   : cost-control and money-saving advice

A custom aggregator then asks a SummarizerAgent to fuse the four expert
opinions into one cohesive travel brief.
